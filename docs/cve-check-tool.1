.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBcve\-check\-tool\fR
is used to check for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) in
Linux distribution source packages.
You may pass the path of a source package directly, or a path to file
which lists all package paths. In both instances, autodetection is used
on the package type. Recursion matching is only supported when you have
explicitly set \fB\-\-type\fR.
